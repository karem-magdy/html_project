        The field of artificial intelligence research was born at Dartmouth College in 1956 where John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" to distinguish the field from cybernetics
        Students produced programs that the press described as "surprising" computers that were learning auditors' strategies, and by 1959 it was reported that they were playing better than average problems of solving human words in algebra, proving logical theories and by the mid-1960s, research in the United States was Significant funding from the Department of Defense and laboratories established worldwide. The founders of Amnesty International were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted that "in twenty years machines will be able to do whatever work a man can do." Marvin Minsky agreed, saying "In a generation ... the problem of creating" artificial intelligence "will be largely solved       
        But they failed to realize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to Sir James's criticism
        In the early 1980s, AI research was revived through the commercial success of expert systems, a form of artificial intelligence program that simulates the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts
        And by 1985 the AI ​​market had reached over a billion dollars. Meanwhile, Japan's fifth-generation computer project has inspired the US and British governments to restore funding for academic research
